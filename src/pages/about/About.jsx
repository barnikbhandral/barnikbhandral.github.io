              <p>
                Over the past 12+ years, I've worked in various areas of digital
                design, including front-end development, email, marketing, and app
                UI/UX. I'm proud to have worn many hats. These days, I focus on
                leading design at GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that lets donors send
                money directly to the world's poorest households.
